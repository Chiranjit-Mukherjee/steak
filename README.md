# steak
This is a program to automate beef (penetration testing tool), based on beefapi. At first start beef then run this program by typing 'python steak.py'.


This has example of using two modules of beef, these are 'fake notification bar' and 'fake flash update'. You can automate any module of beef based on OS, Browser or both used by your victim. To make this social engineering attack easy I have already added few images in 'image' folder (for 'Fake Flash Update' attack). Just need to place these images to proper location along with your malware. I hope you'll enjoy it.
